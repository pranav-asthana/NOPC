# To change for new dataset
engine/trainer.py (Need to figure out how loss is being calculated(RGB-A stuff) and update for new dataset)
modeling/generatic_model.py and pcprenderer.py (Just need to make sure nothing breaks, don't edit functionality much)
tools/* (Just the callers need to be updated here, so should be easy)
